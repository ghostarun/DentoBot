```

The boundaries are deliberate. Slicer owns interactive medical-image state;
WSL2 owns dependency-heavy compute; the robot runtime owns hardware safety and
real-time behavior.

## UI strategy

### Phase A: extension-based workflow development

Develop `DENTOWorkflow` as the single user-facing home module inside an
official Slicer installation. It will present a staged UI such as:

1. Case and imaging
2. Segmentation
3. Planning
4. Registration and calibration
5. Navigation and simulation
6. Robot connection
7. Review and export

Only implemented stages are enabled. Standard Slicer slice and 3D views stay
visible. Developer tools and other Slicer modules remain available to the
developer, even though routine workflow users should not need them.

The generated `DentalNavPlanning` threshold example is not the product UI and
is excluded from the extension build. Its useful experiments may be migrated
into correctly named DENTO modules after review.

### Phase B: reduced custom application

After end-to-end workflow validation, create a custom Slicer build using the
Slicer Custom Application Template or supported Slicer build options. Set the
DENTO Workflow as the home module, bundle required extensions, and disable
or hide irrelevant modules, menus, and toolbars.

This phase changes packaging and presentation, not the MRML data model or
workflow contracts developed in Phase A.

## Step 0 imaging architecture

DENTOBOT does not implement a DICOM parser or renderer. The first workflow
page provides a minimal DENTOBOT-controlled entry point that:

1. Opens Slicer's DICOM browser/import workflow.
2. Lets the user load a DICOM series into the MRML scene.
3. Selects or confirms the resulting `vtkMRMLScalarVolumeNode`.
4. Shows volume identity, dimensions, spacing, scalar range, orientation, and
   geometry status.
5. Uses standard Slicer slice and 3D views for inspection.
6. Stores the selected volume in the DENTOWorkflow parameter node.

Original DICOM is never rewritten. Auxiliary or malformed files are handled
through a non-destructive clean working copy outside the source dataset.

## Slicer module organization

Initially prefer one workflow module with internal logic classes instead of
forcing users to switch between many modules:

```text
DENTOWorkflowWidget
|
+-- Imaging page
+-- Segmentation page
+-- Planning page
+-- Registration/navigation pages (later)

DENTOWorkflowLogic
|
+-- Case and MRML orchestration
+-- Inference process adapter
+-- Planning operations
+-- Validation and metadata operations
```

Split logic into additional Python files or hidden modules only when a
boundary becomes independently reusable or testable. Modules communicate
through MRML nodes and explicit interfaces, not widget-to-widget access.

All new module identifiers use `DENTO` plus PascalCase. `DENTOWorkflow` is the
home/orchestration module. If segmentation, registration, trajectory planning,
navigation, or robot integration later warrant separate modules, their names
will be `DENTOSegmentation`, `DENTORegistration`, `DENTOTrajectory`, and
similarly structured identifiers. User-facing labels may contain spaces.

## External inference architecture

### Package boundary

The repository will contain an ordinary Python package under `Inference/`:

```text
Inference/
|-- pyproject.toml
|-- environment.yml
|-- src/dentobot_inference/
|   |-- __main__.py
|   |-- cli.py
|   |-- health.py
|   |-- roundtrip.py
|   `-- segmentation.py
|-- tests/
`-- dependency lock file       # after compatibility validation
```

It must run and be testable without Slicer. The first implemented commands
are:

```text
python -m dentobot_inference health --json --require-cuda
python -m dentobot_inference roundtrip --input <input.nii> --output <roundtrip.nii> --result-json <result.json> --run-id <uuid>
python -m dentobot_inference segment-teeth --input <input.nii> --output <teeth-segmentation.nii> --result-json <result.json> --run-id <uuid>
```

### Bridge A, Bridge B, and Bridge C

The integration slices establish one boundary in independently testable stages:

- **Bridge A — environment health:** `DENTOWorkflow` launches the exact Python
  interpreter configured by the user inside the named WSL distribution. The
  backend reports interpreter identity, package versions, PyTorch import
  health, CUDA availability, and device names as JSON. CUDA failure is
  explicit; there is no silent CPU fallback.
- **Bridge B — image round trip:** Slicer exports the selected scalar volume to
  an isolated run directory as NIfTI. The WSL backend loads, rewrites, reloads,
  and checks its affine, shape, voxel type, and voxel checksum. Slicer then
  validates the returned MRML volume's dimensions, scalar type, and IJK-to-RAS
  matrix before retaining it in the scene.
- **Bridge C — GPU teeth segmentation:** the same selected-volume and process
  boundary runs TotalSegmentator `teeth` on CUDA device 0, validates a
  multilabel NIfTI plus schema-versioned metrics, then creates a named and
  colorized `vtkMRMLSegmentationNode`. Binary-labelmap and closed-surface
  representations provide interactive 2D and 3D display.

All commands use the same asynchronous adapter, bounded live output, process
exit status, schema-versioned JSON, and argument-list construction. Neither
Slicer nor the backend command installs packages, edits Slicer, or treats the
artifact directory as a queue. Bridge C replaces TotalSegmentator's implicit
weight downloader with a cache-only guard and rejects unavailable CUDA rather
than silently using the CPU.

### Runtime boundary

The Slicer module runs in Slicer's embedded Windows Python interpreter. The
inference package runs in a separate Linux Python interpreter inside WSL2.
Linux PyTorch/CUDA modules cannot be imported into the Windows Slicer process,
and MRML node objects cannot be passed directly into the Linux process.

The boundary is therefore an explicitly controlled external process, not a
Python import and not a folder-based job service.

### Direct process execution

For each inference request, the Slicer adapter:

1. Validates the selected source volume and backend configuration.
2. Creates a unique run ID and short staging directory.
3. Exports the source volume to NIfTI with its affine intact.
4. Starts `wsl.exe` asynchronously with an argument list containing the WSL
   distribution, absolute Linux Python interpreter, module name, input,
   output, result metadata path, and run ID. Bridge C itself fixes execution
   to CUDA device 0.
5. Streams structured stdout and ordinary diagnostic output into the Slicer
   UI without blocking the Qt event loop.
6. Supports cancellation and records the terminal process exit code.
7. On success, validates the output and imports it into MRML.

Conceptually, the argument list represents:

```text
wsl.exe
  --distribution <distro>
  --exec <linux-python>
  -m dentobot_inference segment-teeth
  --input /mnt/c/DENTOBOTRuns/<run-id>/input.nii
  --output /mnt/c/DENTOBOTRuns/<run-id>/teeth-segmentation.nii
  --result-json /mnt/c/DENTOBOTRuns/<run-id>/result.json
  --run-id <run-id>
```

The implementation passes these as separate process arguments. It does not
concatenate a shell command, depend on interactive environment activation, or
use a watched folder. The WSL distribution and Python interpreter path are
explicit configuration values verified by the health check.

### Run artifacts

Use a short, configurable staging root such as `C:\DENTOBOTRuns`. Each run
has an isolated UUID directory visible to WSL2 under `/mnt/c/DENTOBOTRuns`:

```text
<run-id>/
|-- input.nii
|-- teeth-segmentation.nii
`-- result.json
```

This directory is a payload, diagnostic, and reproducibility artifact. It is
not polled as a queue and does not control execution. Large model computation
may copy data into the WSL-native filesystem internally if measurement shows
that mounted Windows-file performance is a bottleneck, but final output must
return to the adapter-visible run directory.

### Process status contract

- Structured progress is emitted as one JSON object per stdout line with an
  event type such as `started`, `progress`, `warning`, or `completed`.
- Human-readable diagnostics are streamed through the process adapter.
- Exit code zero means the command reached a successful terminal state;
  nonzero exit codes distinguish invalid input, environment/model failure,
  GPU failure, out-of-memory, cancellation, and inference failure.
- The Slicer adapter treats a success exit code without valid output and
  metadata as a failed run.

### Result contract

`result.json` includes at minimum:

- schema version, run ID, command, and terminal status
- actionable error code/message when unsuccessful
- backend, task, model/package versions, and weights identifier when available
- requested/actual device, CUDA version, and GPU name
- start/end timestamps and runtime
- input dimensions, spacing, scalar type, and affine
- output filename, dimensions, spacing, affine, and integer label type
- label ID-to-name mapping and segment count
- inference duration, peak allocated/reserved GPU memory, foreground voxel and
  physical volume totals, and per-label voxel/volume metrics

### Import invariants

Before creating or updating a `vtkMRMLSegmentationNode`, validate:

- run ID and schema are expected
- process exited successfully and result status is successful
- output exists and is readable
- shape and physical geometry match the input within defined tolerances
- labels are non-negative integers
- every nonzero label has metadata

The imported segmentation receives namespaced `DENTOBOT.*` attributes that
link it to its source volume, inference result metadata, model/package
versions, CUDA device, runtime, GPU memory, and artifact paths. Bridge C makes
the validated result visible.

Step 3A adds an MRML-native review surface without copying or modifying mask
geometry. The existing `teethSegmentation` parameter reference drives a
segmentation selector and a grouped, FDI-aware label explorer. Search and
selection live in the widget; segment visibility, per-segment emphasis, global
2D/3D visibility, and opacity live in the segmentation display node and
therefore follow normal scene persistence. `Show All`, `Hide All`, and
`Isolate Selected` act only on display properties. Correction, approval state,
and Segment Editor handoff remain later Step 3 increments.

## Service evolution

The one-shot direct CLI process is the baseline because it is simple,
inspectable, independently testable, and under the Slicer adapter's lifecycle
control. A persistent localhost or remote service is introduced only if
measurements show a material need for lower repeated-call latency, shared GPU
scheduling, multi-client access, or remote inference. OpenIGTLink is reserved
for live transforms and device data, not bulk AI inference.

## Repository and documentation structure

```text

|-- DentalNavPlanning/          # disabled legacy scaffold and experiment

|   `-- logbook.md              # timestamped session/reasoning history
`-- CMakeLists.txt
```

The uppercase documents are controlled, concise sources for accepted context,
architecture, roadmap, and the formal inference reproducibility procedure. The
two lowercase raw records are append-oriented sources of detail:
`changelog.md` describes actual changes, while `logbook.md` preserves ideas,
prompts, decisions, attempts, failures, fixes, reversions, and unresolved work.
When the accepted baseline changes, update the applicable controlled documents
and record the reason and effect in both raw records.

The repository files are canonical and are mirrored byte-for-byte as Markdown
in the connected `IITM Dentobot/docs` Google Drive folder for use by the
non-Codex project chat. Existing Drive file IDs are updated in place. A request
to update the changelog or logbook also triggers synchronization of those
files and any other design documents changed in the same batch. The mirror
contains documentation only; patient data, run artifacts, models, and secrets
are excluded.

## Planning and registration architecture

- Dental annotations and AI outputs live in segmentation/markup nodes.
- A trajectory is an explicit two-point line with documented entry/target
  semantics and world-RAS length.
- Planning approval is explicit state, invalidated when relevant anatomy,
  trajectory, or registration changes.
- Registration, calibration, tracking, and tool poses are transform nodes in
  a documented frame tree.
- Metrics such as FRE, target error, lateral error, angular error, and depth
  error are computed in reusable logic and displayed by the workflow UI.

## Robot architecture and ROS decision gate

Slicer communicates only with a high-level `RobotAdapter` interface:

```text
connect / disconnect
getCapabilities
loadApprovedPlan
getState
simulateMotion
requestMotion
cancelMotion
acknowledgeFault
```

The initial implementation is a simulator. The hardware adapter and transport
(vendor SDK, local IPC, TCP, serial, or another protocol) are selected only
after robot requirements are known.

ROS/ROS2 is reconsidered if the project needs existing robot drivers, MoveIt,
distributed nodes, standardized transform tooling, or a broader robotics
ecosystem. It is not adopted merely as a message transport. Regardless of
transport, low-level motion and safety never run in the Slicer Python process.

## Packaging and deployment

- Development: official pinned Slicer version plus source extension path.
- AI backend: documented WSL2 distro, isolated environment, locked Python
  dependencies, model cache, and health check.
- Workflow release: packaged DENTOBOT extension plus backend setup guide.
- Final research application: custom Slicer package with DENTO modules
  bundled and irrelevant UI/modules disabled.
